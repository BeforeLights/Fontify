![Fontify Icon](icon128.png)

Fontify is a browser extension for Firefox and Chromium that helps you identify and find download sources for fonts you encounter on the web.

## Features

*   🔍 **Font Identification on Hover:** Simply hover your cursor over any text element on a webpage to see a tooltip displaying its font family, weight, and style.
*   🖱️📄 **On-Click Font Details & Downloads:** Click on any text element to open a floating panel. This panel shows detailed font information and provides direct links to download the font family from various trusted sources.
*   📚 **Multiple Font Sources:** Includes links to:
    *   Google Fonts
    *   Adobe Fonts
    *   DaFont
    *   CufonFonts
    *   Fontesk
*   💡 **Toggle On/Off:** Easily enable or disable the extension by clicking its icon in the browser toolbar. The icon badge will indicate its current state (ON/OFF).
*   🎯 **Context-Aware:** Intelligently ignores images and other non-text elements, only activating for actual text content.
*   ✨ **User-Friendly UI:** The floating panel appears conveniently next to your cursor and is designed for a smooth user experience.

## How to Use

1.  **Enable the Extension:** Click the Fontify icon in your browser toolbar. The badge should display "ON".
2.  **Hover to Identify:** Move your mouse cursor over any text on a webpage. A small tooltip will appear showing the font's basic information.
3.  **Click for Details & Downloads:** Click on the text. A panel will appear near your cursor, displaying:
    *   Full font details (family, weight, style, size).
    *   A list of websites where you can find and download the font family.
4.  **Disable the Extension:** Click the Fontify icon again. The badge will change to "OFF", and all font identification features will be deactivated.

## Project Files

*   ⚙️ `manifest.json`: The core file that defines the extension\'s properties, permissions, and components.
*   🧠 `background.js`: Handles the extension\'s enable/disable state, toolbar icon clicks, and badge text updates.
*   💻 `content.js`: Injected into web pages to detect fonts on hover, handle clicks on text elements, and display the font information tooltip and the detailed floating panel.
*   🎨 `styles.css`: Contains the CSS rules for styling the on-page tooltip and the floating font information panel.
*   🖼️ `popup.html` & `popup.js`: (Currently unused for the main toggle functionality but kept for potential future use or alternative UI). The `default_popup` in `manifest.json` has been removed so clicking the action button toggles the extension.

*   📖 `README.md`: This file.
